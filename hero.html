<p> Zendaya is an American actress who has starred in a countless number of award winning films and television shows. She first found fame around the age of thirteen when she landed a leading role in Disney's, Shake it up. Zendaya has since starred in a few of my favorite movies and tv shows, like Spider Man and Euphoria. She is also an aspiring model and fashion designer who has partnered with many well known designers and who has produced her own line. The sucessful actress has also been on the cover of many famous magazines, Vogue being one of them. And what I find to be the most remarkable, is the fact that she has accomplished this all, while only being twenty-four years old.
    

<p> I admire Zendaya for many different reasons. But honestly,it's not even her accomplishments that really draw me to her. Instead it's probably just the fact that I feel like she's just a genuinely really cool person, and this means she'd be really fun to hang out with. Now I know I do not know her personally; therefore, I cannot be 100% that my speculations about her are true.But she still is someone that I look up to and she inspires me. She is litterally living what I would consider is my dream. Not to mention the fact that she is absolutely stunning.
